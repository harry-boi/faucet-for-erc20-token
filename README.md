## Overview

This project implements an ERC token using the Solidity programming language OPenzepplin ERC token standard and tested with Foundry, a powerful Ethereum development environment.

## Features

- **Standard ERC Token**: Implements standard ERC token functionality, allowing for transfer, balance check, and approval methods.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Configure the token name, symbol, and initial supply as per your requirements.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes tests written in Foundry to verify token functionality and adherence to ERC standards.

## Prerequisites

- **Foundry**: Install Foundry by following the instructions at [https://getfoundry.sh/](https://getfoundry.sh/)
- **Node.js and npm** (optional): For additional tools like Hardhat or ethers.js if needed in the future.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harry-boi/faucet-for-erc20-token.git
